### Race condition -
> A race condition happens when two or more operations run at the same time, and they depend on the same data ‚Äî but the final result changes based on which one finishes first.

In code, this can cause unexpected bugs when:

- Two users try to update the same data at the same time.

- Both read the old value before either one writes the new value.

- You end up with wrong or inconsistent data.

> for eg -  Transactions in FunWallet.

- let Balance: ‚Çπ1000

- Two transfers of ‚Çπ600 happen at the same time.

- Both check: ‚ÄúIs balance ‚â• ‚Çπ600?‚Äù ‚Üí Yes.

- Both deduct ‚Çπ600 ‚Üí Final balance = ‚Çπ‚àí200 (which is wrong).

- Should‚Äôve allowed only one transfer.

## üîí How MongoDB Prevents This: Document-Level Locking
> MongoDB solves this using document-level locking during transactions.

- What it means:
When a transaction starts and reads a document (like your account), MongoDB locks that document.

- Other transactions trying to read/write the same document must wait until the first one finishes.

- This ensures that only one transaction can change a document at a time.

----

> Summary - A race condition is when code runs too fast and overlaps ‚Äî MongoDB avoids this by locking each document during a transaction so only one change happens at a time.
